# DIKEBenchmarker

## Project Setup

### With the sqlite databse

1. Clone the repository and its submodules:

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ADA-research/DIKEBenchmarker.git
   cd DIKEBenchmarker
   ```

2. Install ``sqlite3`` on your system, chances are it is already installed, you can check if it is installed with:

   ```bash
   sqlite3 --version
   ```

3. Run the setup script to configure git filters and restore the database:

   ```bash
   cd src/DIKEBenchmarker/data/db
   ./setup.sh
   cd ../../../..
   ```

4. The database will be automatically restored from the dump.


### Without the database

If you prefer to work from your own files or from the data originating from GBD, you do not need to load the submodules.

You can simply clone the repository and its submodules:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ADA-research/DIKEBenchmarker.git
   cd DIKEBenchmarker
   ```


## random remarks

you can fetch the path of the database with :

```
db_path = importlib.resources.files("DIKEBenchmarker.data.db").joinpath("sustainablecompetition.db")
```
